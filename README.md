# Analysis of Four Different Regression Algorithms for prediction of the adjusted closing price of the stock

Using four different regression algorithms:
(1) Decision Tree Regressor(DTR)
(2) K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
(3) Random Forest Regressor (RFR)
(4) Support Vector Machines (SVM) 

from Machine Learning (ML) to analyze which worked best to forecast the value based on the time series by calculating three different metrics 
(i) Mean Absolute Error (MAE), 
ii) Mean Square Error (MSE) and 
iii) r2 score (R2) 

to evaluate the performance of the models created based on various regressor algorithms. Here in this case, I am predicting the adjusted closing price of the stock by training them using historical data.
